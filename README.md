# 🧠 CNN Image Classification Project

This project is part of the final assessment for the university module and involves developing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for image classification using PyTorch. The entire model training and evaluation process is conducted in Google Colab.

## 📌 Project Overview

The project focuses on solving a classification task using a custom CNN model trained on image data. The core tasks included:

- **Dataset Selection**:
  - A suitable dataset was chosen.
  - Images were preprocessed for training if necessary.

- **Model Design**:
  - A custom CNN architecture was developed using PyTorch.
  - The model was trained and evaluated using various hyperparameter combinations.

- **Evaluation**:
  - Accuracy and loss curves were tracked.
  - Final model accuracy was compared across different configurations.

## 🧪 Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: PyTorch, NumPy, Matplotlib
- **Development Environment**: Google Colab
- **Data Handling**: Google Drive
